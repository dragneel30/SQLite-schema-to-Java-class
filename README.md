# SQLite-schema-to-Java-class
A utility I made for generating java class based from SQLite schema. 

# Note:
When you copy the create statement from sqlite dbms you have to change the double qoute(if theres double qoute) into backtick.

I use this when im not using an ORM in my development.

feel free to use it.
