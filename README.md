# SQLite-schema-to-Java-class
A utility I made for generating java class based from SQLite schema. 

I use this when im not using an ORM in my development.

# How to use:
the program accepts a string as a command line parameter which is the create statement of your table.


# Note:
When you copy the create statement from sqlite dbms you have to change the double qoute(if theres double qoute) into backtick, and put backtick if theres no backtick in table or fields.



feel free to use it.
